# C1. Glossary of DeFi Terms

- Audit
- APY
- Aggregator: decentralised platforms that search for ideal swap rates when purchasing token alongside the highest possible yields for farming
- AML
- AMM: Automated Market Maker, an approach that offers liquidity between crypto trading pairs with a pool of cryptocurrencies
- ATH
- Bonding Curve: basically an equation that facilitates a seamless cause and effect relationship between the price and circulating supply of a cryptocurrency
- CeFi
- TradFi
- CEX
- DEX
- Collateral
- Composable
- Compound Interest: The trait of composability basically implies that a DeFi token, protocol, or solution can easily integrate with others, thereby providing improved usability and efficiency. 
- Contact Address: Liquidity providers take on the responsibility of managing decentralized exchanges rather than centralized hosts. Contract address helps in verifying the legitimacy of tokens traded on the decentralized exchange.
- Crypto Twitter
- DAO
- Derivatives
- ERC-20
- Fair Launch: The fair launch of a DeFi project implies that it did not have an angel investor, VC, or third-party investor. In a fair launch, the founder of the development team does not hold any tokens and distributes them in the community.
- Flash Loans: Flash loans basically refer to instant cryptocurrency loans that do not require any KYC checks, collateral, or any type of upfront investment from borrowers. The interesting highlight of flash loans is that borrowers must repay the loan in the same transaction block as the loan.
- Game Theory
- Gas
- Governance and Governance Tokens
- Impermanent Loss: the loss of deposited assets in the event of price fluctuations while offering liquidity to DeFi AMMs
- KYC
- Liquidity
- Liquidity Mining: the practice of depositing tokens in a DeFi protocol to offer liquidity in return for rewards on the stake deposited. The rewards for liquidity mining are generally provided in the native asset of the protocol.
- Liquidity Pool:an important element in the design of decentralized exchanges that ensures liquidity between assets. Decentralized exchanges use the liquidity pools for crowdsourcing liquidity.
- Liquidity Provider: any DeFi participant depositing their tokens in liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges
-LP Token: represents the stake of a liquidity provider in a specific liquidity pool. DEXs mint new LP tokens to represent the staked assets of a liquidity provider in the liquidity pool.
- Metamask: an ERC-20 standard crypto wallet tailored for seamless interaction with different decentralized Finance or DeFi platforms
- Decentralised Oracle: online tools tailored for offering on-chain and off-chain price data to DeFi protocols or blockchain networks
- ROI
- Slippage
- Smart Contract
- Stablecoin
- Synthetics
- Tokenomics
- TVL: total value locked, the total amount of value staked or deposited in a specific DeFi platform. The higher estimates of TVL clearly imply improved liquidity, as well as confidence in DeFi exchanges.
- Underlying Assets
- Yield
- Yield Farming
- Staking: the practice of depositing crypto assets in DeFi protocols to generate yield, generally measured in terms of APY

# C2. Decentralised Finance Fundamentals
## What is DeFi?
DeFi is an oepn ecosystem featuring financial applications developed on top of blockchain networks.

# Key features
- Decentralisation
- Accessibility
- Transparency
- Programmability
- Immutability
- Interoperability

# C3. The Interplay Between Blockchain and DeFi
- Bitcoin
- Ethereum

# C4. Understanding Decentralised Exchanges
- Three notable categories of DEX
   1. DEX featuring on-chain order book
   2. DEX featuring off-chain order book: utilise a centralised system to host order books
   3. DEX featuring Automated Market Maker system: Automated Market Makers are basically smart contracts that take away the need to maintain order books with decentralized exchanges

## Benefits and Risks of DEX
- Benefits
   - Low liquidity of tokens
   - Front running attakcs
   - Smart contract bugs
   - Not suited for high trading volume

- Risks
   - High availability of tokens
   - Does not require KYC processes
   - Lower counterparty risk
   - Improved security

# C5. DeFi Ecosystem
## The Case of Automated Market Makers
- It works like a platform that readily offers the opportunity for trades between a liquidity pool and users.
- The platform or the protocol only serves the role of pricing assets and execution of trades through smart contracts. Most importantly, it maintains the pricing of assets in trading pairs while ensuring that the liquidity in the protocol remains constant.
- Setbacks such as the need for depending on liquidity providers and yield farmers

## Benefits and Issues
- Benefits
   1. Provides token liquidity
   2. Diminish price manipulation
   3. Provides Transparency

- Issues
   1. Limits the flexibility of liquidity-providers
   2. Expose users to impermanent loss
   3. Risk of front-running attack

## The Value of Liquidity Mining
- Earning passive income with crypto assets by offering them as liquidity to DEX
- Rewards are a share of trading fee paid by traders for swapping tokens on a DEX
- Risk of impermanent loss, the opportunity cost associated with holding an asset in comparison to offering it as liquidity and earning rewards

## The Importance of Yield Farming
- Major difference between liquidity mining and yield farming is that yield farmers receive additional rewards in the form of LP or governance tokens
- The governance model of DeFi projects is unique and defines the functionalities of the project
- A person offering liquidity to DEXs featuring a governance model can earn governance tokens alongside the fees for offering liquidity. 
- Key differences
   1. High rate of competitiveness among yield farmers
   2. Opportunities for additional rewards in yield farming
   3. Yield farmers can receive governance tokens or LP tokens alongside fee rewards.

## Understanding Flash Loans
- Help crypto owners take instant crypto loans without offering any collateral
- Flash loans must be returned within the same transaction block to complete the loan.

## DeFi Tokens
### Wrapped Tokens
- Tokenized representations of other assets and work to resolve the discrepancies between different on-chain systems

### Governance Tokens
- Community involvement is crucial for achieving true decentralization.
- The tokens enable individuals to create and vote on governance proposals, while community members can spend tokens to influence traits and the direction of a protocol.

# C6. Top DeFi Use Cases
- Asset Management
- KYT Mechanism
- DAOs
- Analytics and Risk Management
- Derivatives and Synthetic Assets

# C7. Security Risks in DeFi
- Wrong Liquidity Pool Estimates
