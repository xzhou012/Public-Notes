# C1: Introduction to Ethereum
- Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform designed to enable developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications(DApps).
- A smart contract is a self-executing piece of code with the terms of the agreement directly written into it.
- These contracts automatically enforce and execute agreements without requiring any intermediaries.

# C2. Ethereum's Blockchain Fundamentals
## Work process
1. Users send transactions
2. Transactions validated by PoS validators
3. Blocks of transaction created and added to the blockchain
4. Smart contracts execute automatically if conditions are met
5. Blockchain updates across all nodes

## Structure of Blocks
1. Block header: metadata such as block number, timestamp, hash of the previous block and a unique block hash
2. Transactions: list of transactions, such as ETH transfers, smart contract interactions, and token swaps
3. State changes: Ethereum maintains a global state, which updates every time a transaction is executed

## Ethereum transactions
- Sender Address
- Receiver Address
- Amount of ETH (if applicable)
- Gas limit and gas price
- Signature
